## What I'm doing now

_Last updated September 16th, 2025_

After an unreleting heat wave, the days are getting cooler and a bit shorter, and I find myself more comfortable in the fine city of Zaragoza, finding more nice spots and getting used to where things are. It helps that there seems to be no shortage of interesting events: I attended this year's edition of the [Birragoza](https://cervezasartesanas.com/birragoza-2025/) Craft Beer Festival at the end of August, and this last weekend I checked out some of the artworks from [Festival Asalto](https://www.festivalasalto.com/)

Work continues to be manageable, and has now demanded that I use the "full" part of full-stack development, since I've been pivoting between backend and frontend tasks, the latter being my focus of these last couple of weeks.

No trips since last time, and none planned for the near future, save for a work trip to DÃ¼sseldorf that has been planned since I started with the company. But that just means I have more money to spend on decorating my flat :D.

Since things have settled down after the move, I've picked up a couple of hobbies again, such as baking and reading, the latter thanks to a random find in a random visit to a bookstore :D. Hoping to also pick up drawing / sketching: the characters from the insanely popular _Hollow Knight: Silksong_ look super nice to draw.

And let's not forget, improving this website also counts as a hobby ;), a hobby for which I have found support by attending a couple of meetups of the [Homebrew Website Club](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club), where I got a chance to show off this fine website and got some interesting ideas. Glad to have a chance to hang out with fellow bloggers and personal website enthusiasts.

Pending quest: find some local friends (for which I would have to get over the ol' social anxiety ðŸ˜…)

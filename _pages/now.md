## What I'm doing now

_Last updated May 20th, 2025_

I started working at the very start of April, which marks my return to the workforce after the two years (and change) of academic sabbatical to complete my master's degree, and I find myself surprisingly content to be back to a 9-to-5 routine, even though I still struggle with waking up early üòÖ. Maybe it's the stability of routine, or the change of pace from the academic / student life, or the fact that I have a salary again after a long while.

Moved to Spain because the job required so, currently living in the city of Vitoria, in the province of √Ålava. Visited Madrid a couple of times because of work, and also a couple of other cities (Barcelona, Zaragoza, Bilbao) in my search for a place to settle for the time being (since the job is, for all efects, fully remote, I am free to chose a city to live in, as long as it is in Spain). Still missing a bit the fine city of Helsinki and my friends there though, so I'll try and fit in a trip there, maybe for Midsummer.

For this first month of work my hobbies have fallen a bit to the side, so I'm trying to get back on track, at least with drawing / sketching. Also trying to not completely abandon my side projects, which at the time include this website. Still faithfully following my favorite podcasts though üòÑ.

Looking forward to: the Oasis reunion concert in Manchester this July ü§©.

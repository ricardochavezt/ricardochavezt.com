## What I'm doing now

_Last updated August 15th, 2025_

ðŸŽ§ Listening to: Oasis - Champagne Supernova ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/track/1wo3UYTeizJHkwYIuLuBPF?si=9cb202d3b2364be2) \| [elsewhere](https://bit.donado.co/Sma3Tg))

July has been a busy month for sure, between visiting apartments and my two scheduled trips. Fortunately, work has not been too demanding, so I've managed to keep my balance.

Taking advantage of the fact that work has not been too demanding, I've been learning some more about the inner workings and architecture of the project we're working on, which has been helped by a team initiative to learn more about the integration and API designing side (for which we use SAP Integration Suite). A bit less poking around with code, a bit more connecting disparate systems and designing interfaces.

The eagerly awaited Oasis reunion concert in Manchester happened on July 19th, and "awesome" falls short to describe it. I went there with my brother; we have both been fans since the early 2000s, and actually went to see them when they performed in our home city of Lima, Peru, so I think you can guess how excited we were to see them in _their_ home city of Manchester. Somehow, "dream come true" _also_ falls short to describe it ðŸ¤©.

Had the opportunity to go on another short trip besides that one, to DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, to attend an on-site workshop with my team at work. It was great to see them face-to-face; the personal connection factor cannot be discounted easily, even when working in software development.

As planned, by the start of August I had moved out of the fine city of Vitoria to the (also fine) city of Zaragoza, which I picked based solely on the vibe I got from a long weekend there and a couple of social media videos my sister shared with me ðŸ˜…. Luckily, so far I have no reason to regret this move, save for the heatwave that is kicking my ass ðŸ˜µ.

These first days of August have been filled with the paperwork and the errands needed when moving to a new city and finding your way around it, so sadly I haven't been able to pick up my more active hobbies ðŸ¥². At least I have been able to keep with my favorite podcasts and I will definitely pick up baking again; next in my priority list is improving a bit this site, especially the <a href="/garden" class="internal-link">Garden</a> section, as well as building another trusty bot to send me links from [my old Tumblr]((https://capuccinoproductions.tumblr.com/)) so that I can re-read (and possibly repost) them.

Upcoming quest: find some local friends (since the only person I know in this new city is my landlord ðŸ˜…)

## What I'm doing now

_Last updated July 8th, 2025_

The end of June marked my first three months in my current job, the first half of which were mostly spent learning and getting accustomed to my team's way of working; this second half we have already started taking on more tasks, starting with simple ones and slowly but steadily taking on more complex ones. Still relying on the more senior members of the team, hopefully less so as time passes.

Had the opportunity to go on a couple of short trips: first to the fine city of Porto, Portugal, for the Primavera Sound music festival and to meet up with some friends I hadn't seen in a long time. Then, a couple of weeks later, I went back to Finland for a reunion of my master's students and alumni in the city of Turku, and also to meet up with my friends still living in Helsinki. I had a lovely time on both trips, but I must admit the weather was lovelier in Porto than in Helsinki and Turku ðŸ˜….  
(After both trips made a dent in my budget ðŸ˜…, there were suppossedly no more trips until further notice -- save for the trip to the Oasis reunion concert -- but my team at work is organizing an on-site workshop in DÃ¼sseldorf so... yeah, there will be trips this month ðŸ˜„.)

Started looking for a place on my own, so by the month of August I might have already moved out of the fine city of Vitoria. Not a fun thing to do, but necessary.

I'm sad to report that my hobbies have fallen a bit to the side ðŸ¥², what with the trips and the looking for a new place, so I'm trying to at least keep up with my reading / collecting habit to keep the <a href="/garden" class="internal-link">Garden</a> nurtured. Still faithfully following my favorite podcasts and content creators though, of which I should make a list, like the "blogroll" section of the blogs of old.

Still looking forward to: the Oasis reunion concert in Manchester this month ðŸ¤©.

## Professional (and academic) experience

(I do have [a LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-chavez-b4092950/)if that's more to your liking)

### Undergraduate studies

I earned my bachelor's degree from [**Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú**](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/), where I studied from 2001 to 2006, graduating with a major in Computing Engineering (*Ingeniería Informática*). I chose my electives more out of curiosity than career awareness, so those included things like "Web technologies" (in a time where terms like "frontend development" did not exist and "Web services" usually meant working with [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) and [WSDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language) because [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) was little more than a PhD thesis and [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) was in its infancy), as well as a course on Aritificial Intelligence, 20 years before the mid-2020s craze of large language models and generative AI.

### First internship and full-time position

On the last year of my bachelors I started as an intern in [**Summa-Tec**](https://www.summatec.net/), a small consultancy firm in Lima, Perú; after graduation, I continued working there as a full-time software developer. My main responsibilities included coding for the various projects the company developed for its clients, which in all cases included Java, sometimes in the form of Web-based projects using the early versions of the [Spring framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) and other times using its [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) capabilities with [Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)) (which is not a thing anymore, I guess?). However, this being a small consultancy firm meant that I usually helped out with some other tasks, which included some occasional server maintenance and system administration tasks.

### First corporate job

On September 2009, I decided to take the leap from the small consulting firm to a bigger, corporate position and accepted a role in [**Banco de Crédito BCP**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/banco-de-credito-bcp/), one of the biggest banks in Perú. I started out as part of a team that basically did technical support to the Treasury and Exchange department, which for the most part meant working with Visual Basic and Microsoft products to maintain the apps developed inside the department and independently from the IT division of the company; later on I would join the IT division in an effort to formalize said applications, which translated to me doing the same tasks, but now adhering to the formal development process of the IT division. Can't really say there was much in the way of working with new or innovative technologies, but the perks of a corporate job made up for it.

### Back into a small, indie company and first leadership experience

Around 2 and a half years later, by the beginning of the 2nd quarter of 2012, I decided to trade the perks of the corporate job for a more exciting role at a small, indie company and joined [**DEVOS Inc**](http://www.devosinc.com/), a company founded by a group of university classmates which, at the time, focused of developing with mobile technologies. I started there as leader of the development team and one of their first iOS developers (back when [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) was the only way to develop for iOS), but, again, this being a smaller company, I usually wore many hats, sharing the system administration and server maintenance tasks with one of the founders and being an active part of the development team.

I think it's fair to say this was one of the most impactful experiences in my career, and not only because it lasted the longest. I learned a good set of new technologies, starting with mobile development in Android using Java and in iOS using first Objective-C and then [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)) when it first came out, then expanding into modern Web development with front-end frameworks like React and back-end development using Python for some projects and Node.js for some others, alongside the patterns that were emerging at that time such as platform-as-a-service (we used [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for a long time) and cloud technologies (we also used [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es) for a while as part of a program from Microsoft aimed at small companies). But also, this was my first experience leading a team: I joined the company not being sure that I was cut out for team leadership, and left competely convinced that I was fully capable of doing so, but also that it was not my cup of tea. And, last but not least, being close to the founding team and sharing part of the resposibility as a leader gave me some insights into all the effort necessary to keep a company running, even a small one, and gave me an appreciation for people that decide to go on the enterpreneurial path, even when I might not be inclined to do so.

### Aside: Teaching experience

During my tenure at DEVOS Inc, I also tried my hand at teaching, first as a teaching assistant at my alma mater for a couple of semesters, and later as a part-time teacher at [CIBERTEC](https://www.cibertec.edu.pe/), teaching courses centered around software development. It was an interesting experience, which allowed me to put my penchant for teaching to a more applied, formal setting; this allowed me to discover that my favorite part of teaching is the teaching itself, the transmission of knowledge, and that my least favorite part is all the administrative / bureaucratic stuff surrounding the act of teaching, such as creating tests, grading them, etc.  
(I would even say it allowed me to be more understanding of teachers and lecturers when I later returned to the classroom as an student.)

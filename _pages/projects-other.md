## Other projects

These are some of the things I've made that are not software:

- [Dreaming of Summer](https://ricardochavezt.substack.com/), a weekly newsletter that ran for two seasons: the first one was during the (northern hemisphere) summer of 2024 (during which it was named the Summer 2024 Fanzine) and the second one was during the first quarter of 2025 (in which it got the name Dreaming of Summer). In the spirit of a favorite newsletter of mine (that of [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.substack.com/)), I shared each week a few of the things I came across on the Internet that I found particularly interesting.
It was quite a nice experiment, and keeping it seasonal and with a defined schedule allowed me to be quite consistent without burning out.  
(The only small regret I have is making it one newsletter with two seasons instead of two newsletters, which might have worked better for showcasing purposes. But either way, I loved making it.)

- [Friday Songbird](/friday-songbird), a music blog in Spanish, now inactive, in which I shared a song each Friday (hence the name), with a little writeup about it, about the artist performing it, how did I discovered it and what I liked the best about it. In a way, it was a long-runnning love letter to music. Originally hosted in [ctrl-c.club](https://ctrl-c.club/), it was custom made using the Gatsby framework; you can check the technical details in <a class="internal-link" href="/projects-software">my list of software projects</a>.

- [La Biblioteca de Babel](/biblioteca-de-babel), and old blog of mine. Not the first blog I created, but the oldest surviving one, mainly because previous ones were deployed on platforms that later disappeared or I didn't take care of creating backups ☹️; this one, on the other hand, was deployed in Heroku, back when they offered free plans and only supported Ruby (those were good times TuT). Not much in the way of content, just a handful of posts, mostly about music.  
(Oh, and also in Spanish.)

- [Capuccino Productions Inc.](https://capuccinoproductions.tumblr.com/), my old Tumblr, now officially finished, and which I used as the space to share all the interesting things I found online. Which is to say, it's sort of the precursor to the newsletters and the <a class="internal-link" href="/garden">digital garden</a>.

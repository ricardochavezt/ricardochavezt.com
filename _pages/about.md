## About me

Hello, I'm Ricardo ChÃ¡vez. I've been dabbling with computers since the late 90s, and I'm currently working as a software engineer. However, I like to think of myself as a maker and/or builder of things, since most of my hobbies or interests revolve around creativity and making things; it just so happens that I chose the building of software as my profession.

After spending most of my life in Lima, PerÃº, where I was born, I decided to pursue a master's degree in Europe ([EDISS](https://www.master-ediss.eu/)), for which I moved first to Finland on August 2022, then to Italy a year later (and then back to Finland for a while). I graduated in October 2024 and, a few months later, moved to Spain to (re-)join the workforce.

Some of the things I like (besides building software or making other things) are: coffee (maybe a little too much ðŸ˜…), anything sweet to go with said coffee, reading (both online and offline), occasionally writing (in the form of blogs and newsletters), drawing, baking and cooking, playing videogames, listening to music (I wrote a sort of love letter to music in the form of a blog called [Friday Songbird](/friday-songbird)), and also occassionally traveling.

I built this website as a home to collect all my previous and currect projects, both <a class="internal-link" href="/projects-software">software</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/projects-other">non-software</a>, and as a way to showcase my work that would be more complete and detailed than a resume. But also, I would like it to become my central place on the internet, somewhere more stable than social media, where I can post content and keep ownership of it, to try and follow the principles of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/Main_Page). And last but not least, I'm trying to build my own <a class="internal-link" href="/garden">digital garden</a>, a place where I can not only collect all the things that I find interesting, but also review and connect them, and hopefully learn something in the process.

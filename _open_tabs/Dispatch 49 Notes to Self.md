Some favorites:

- "The strongest dancers in my dance class take the combo and make it their own. Like all great artists, they combine foundational technique with a unique wildness. And they *commit* to it. A lesson for artists of any medium."
- "For goodness’ sake, wait your turn to exit a plane."
- "When you see a cute dog, make sure to say, 'Hey look at that dog.'"
- "Try giving your anxiety a name and separate it from yourself. (“Thanks, for airing your concerns, Priscilla, but I’ll take it from here.”)"

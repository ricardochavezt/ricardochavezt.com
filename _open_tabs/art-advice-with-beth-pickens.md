Hey y’all,

Last week I had the pleasure to chat with art coach [Beth Pickens](https://www.bethpickens.com/), author of *[Make Your Art No Matter What](https://geni.us/FUxCuR)* and *[Your Art Will Save Your Life](https://geni.us/JzpQL)**. *Beth and I share many of the same core messages, but I come at making art from the inside of being a working artist and Beth comes at it from the outside of working with artists, so she picks up things that I miss.

You can watch our conversation in the video above or listen to it below:

Beth started out with a list of 10 tips for artists based on the things her clients are dealing with right now. I drew them out on index cards:

Beth converted to Judaism by way of feminism (all the feminist writers she liked were Jewish) and I really enjoy hearing about how her religious practice has influenced her work. She hipped me to [the importance of taking a day off](https://austinkleon.com/2021/04/19/i-am-no-longer-weakened-by-the-weekend/) and Rabbi Heschel’s *[The Sabbath](https://geni.us/UyNKxb)*, which has become one of my favorite books.

Before our conversation, I re-read my notes in her books and wrote them out on index cards as a way to refresh.

Beth believes that the artist needs to do 3 things:

1. Consume as much art as they can.
2. Join a community of artists and build relationships.
3. Make their art no matter what.

In other words: *[steal](https://austinkleon.com/steal)*, *[share](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work)*, and *[keep going](https://austinkleon.com/keepgoing)*.

My favorite idea of Beth’s is that **artists suffer when they don’t make their art**.

“Artists are people who are profoundly compelled to make their creative work,” she writes, “and when they are distanced from their practice, their life quality suffers.”

For years, the message I got was: *If you can do anything else, you should. *That confused me, because I thought, *Well, sure, I could do anything else. I could be a damned surgeon if I wanted to! *But now I know that if I don’t do creative work… I suffer. I’m not a whole person. If I don’t show up to the studio, it’s harder to show up for the people in my life. (A lesson I learned the hard way as a young dad.) Sure, I *could* do something else, but to not have a creative practice would diminish me and make me a not-so-nice person to be around.

Here are more (personal) notes I doodled from our chat:

As always, I’d love to hear what resonates with y’all and what you’d like to hear more about.

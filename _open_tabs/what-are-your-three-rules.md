## What are your three rules?

Itâ€™s not just our tech enabled world that runs by algorithms. Us meat machines, us humans, we one and all have our own programming, our deeply embedded rules that determine the decisions we make, the paths we walk, and who and how we show up in the world.

The first part of growth and development is figuring out what our rules are. Finding language for our programming. The second part is often unbugging the program, and rewriting your maxims for the person you want to be, rather than the person you once were.

Here are three rules for you that I bet you havenâ€™t considered â€¦ at least not fully:

- Donâ€™t wait until you know who you are to get started
- Learn to take a punch
- The Ordinary + Extra Attention = The Extraordinary!

Each one of those is from a different Austin Kleon book.

â€˜Donâ€™t wait until you know who you are to get startedâ€™ is #2 from his breakout hit, *[Steal Like An Artist](https://geni.us/qF3c)*.

â€˜Learn to take a punchâ€™ is #8 from *[Show Your Work](https://geni.us/UfvZA)*.

And, â€˜The Ordinary + Extra Attention = The Extraordinary!â€™ is #5, in the third book of the trilogy, *[Keep Going](https://geni.us/0MgS1wZ)*.

Now I had thirty rules to pick from - each book has ten maxims - but I picked these three for you. Because I know one of them was just what you needed to hear.

And Iâ€™m curious â€¦ which one was the one that struck a chord?

The rule I like? â€˜Creativity is subtraction.â€™ Itâ€™s from* Steal Like an Artist*. I cunningly removed that from the list of three, I offered you earlier onâ€¦

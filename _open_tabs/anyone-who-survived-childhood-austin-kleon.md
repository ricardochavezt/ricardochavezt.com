This [picket sign](https://twitter.com/taylorberger69/status/1653848600601042945) reminded me of one of my favorite cartoons by Alex Gregory and Flannery O’Connor in *[Mystery and Manners](https://geni.us/h03zY)*:

> The fact is that anybody who has survived his childhood has enough information about life to last him the rest of his days. If you can’t make something out of a little experience, you probably won’t be able to make it out of a lot.

Some vegetarians say they won’t eat anything with a face — maybe I’ll say I won’t read anything that didn’t have a childhood.

An interesting application of Zen philosophy to programming, found via [Every Programmer Should Know](https://github.com/mtdvio/every-programmer-should-know?tab=readme-ov-file). (It might interest me particularly because of my interest both in Zen Buddhism and programming.)

To briefly sum it up:
1. Focus
2. Keep your mind clear
3. Beginner's mind
4. No ego
5. There is no career goal
6. Shut up
7. Mindfulness. Care. Awareness
8. There is no boss
9. Do something else
10. There is nothing special

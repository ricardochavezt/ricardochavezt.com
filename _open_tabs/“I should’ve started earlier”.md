Part of a month-long series of daily meditations "to serve as spiritual fuel for you, a culture maker". However, I think these are applicable to life in general, even if we don't consider ourselves "culture makers".

One of the interesting bits:

>Nothing will snuff out the imagination faster than sneering at yourself for what you haven’t done in the past. The way you treat the actions and performance of your past self not only inhibits the actions of your present self, but unless it’s changed, it will be the exact same way that your future self treats what you do today.

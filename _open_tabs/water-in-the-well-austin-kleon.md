“Find your own water,” 2016

Water is always on one’s mind in Texas. We are in a bad drought down here, but luckily, for me, for once, the drought is literal and not metaphorical.

Some Hemingway (from [his ](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4825/the-art-of-fiction-no-21-ernest-hemingway)*[Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4825/the-art-of-fiction-no-21-ernest-hemingway)*[ interview](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4825/the-art-of-fiction-no-21-ernest-hemingway)), courtesy of [George Saunders](https://georgesaunders.substack.com/p/office-hours-722):

> Trying to write something of permanent value is a full-time job even though only a few hours a day are spent on the actual writing. A writer can be compared to a well. There are as many kinds of wells as there are writers. The important thing is to have good water in the well, and it is better to take a regular amount out than to pump the well dry and wait for it to refill.

And elsewhere:

> I learned never to empty the well of my writing, but always to stop when there was still something there in the deep part of the well, and let it refill at night from the springs that fed it.

Hemingway here is talking about subtraction — John McPhee [talks about the addition](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5997/the-art-of-nonfiction-no-3-john-mcphee):

> If somebody says to me, You’re a prolific writer—it seems so odd. It’s like the difference between geological time and human time. On a certain scale, it does look like I do a lot. But that’s my day, all day long, sitting there wondering when I’m going to be able to get started. And the routine of doing this six days a week puts a little drop in a bucket each day, and that’s the key. Because if you put a drop in a bucket every day, after three hundred and sixty-five days, the bucket’s going to have some water in it.

(All emphasis mine.)

Plumbing issues are usually matters [of input and output](https://austinkleon.com/2019/12/19/your-output-depends-on-your-input/).

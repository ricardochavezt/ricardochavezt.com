III.

“Education teaches you to analyze. Entrepreneurship teaches you to create.

The educated mindset is great at dissecting and criticizing. What did Shakespeare mean here? What were the major forces of this historical period? What is the limiting reagent in this chemical reaction?

The entrepreneurial mindset is great at building and improving. Design a better product. Craft a new marketing plan. Stop talking about what’s wrong and make something better.

The trick is to keep learning, but to never lose your ability to build.”

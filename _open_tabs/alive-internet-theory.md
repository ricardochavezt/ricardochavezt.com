Campbell Walker (a.k.a Struthless) offers a plan (and lots of inspiration) to make the theory in the title a reality (in opposition to the [Dead Internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory)).

It's really good seeing people out there fighting the good fight against the doom and gloom and the [enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys) of the internet.

And yes, the phrase at the end is true: hope is punk.

Glad to see a video in Spanish on the topic of digital gardensâ€¦ It even references the essay from Mike Caulfied, [The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/), as well as the work of [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden)

Interesting insights from the publishing platform on the use of AI. If this is to be believed, then most of the creators that use AI leverage it as an aid / assistant for things such as brainstorming, research and writing assistance, instead of using it for plain generation.

Concerns are present even among the creators using AI, mostly on the ethical side as well as in the effects that AI use might have on their own creative voices / practice.

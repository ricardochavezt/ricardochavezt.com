The other day I joked to a friend, “I’m just trying to stay alive until dinnertime.”

I have written before about [my very simple rule](https://austinkleon.com/2018/08/27/a-very-simple-rule/) that has served me well: “**Don’t think much about your life after dinnertime.”**

But this is my new motto: “I’m living for dinnertime!”

I am very “food motivated,” so it’s probably the diet talking, but when things go sideways, I focus on how good it is going to be to have dinner. If I can get to dinner, I’m good.

And once I’ve had dinner, I’m at home and at peace and I don’t care much what happens. I try not to think about my life or my problems until morning, at which point I start living for dinnertime again.

I am reminded of what Clancy Martin writes in *[How Not to Kill Yourself](https://geni.us/CippGxN)*: “Suicide is indeed a human possibility, but, and somewhat paradoxically, for that very reason, we don’t have to choose it. After all, you can always kill yourself tomorrow.” Wait a day and see how you feel. Repeat ad infinitum.

A little too bleak for me, as I’m not suicidal, so for now I’ll stick with what’s working: “Living for dinnertime!”

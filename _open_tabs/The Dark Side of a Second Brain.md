Taking notes so I can avoid these pitfalls ;)

Summing up:

1. Digital hoarding - pure accumulation without revision
2. Weakened memory - _cognitive offloading_ results in weaker recall
3. System maintenance trap - spending more time maintaining the system than using it
4. Decision fatigue - hyper-organization and excessive complexity causes you to abandon the system
5. False productivity - note-taking feels productive but doesn't lead to learning

To avoid these pitfalls: keep your system simple, and give it a use, don't just convert it into a dumping ground. If possible, link your notes. Simple systems can lead to serendipitous connections that a more complex organization will not allow.

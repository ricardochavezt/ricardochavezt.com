More advice on how to read more... which I maybe should start applying ðŸ˜….

Some points that stood out for me:

- putting away your devices is step 1 ðŸ˜…

- remember reading for _pleasure_:

  > Remember: *pleasure fun hobby fun pleasure.* Strip all that shit in your head awayâ€”your high school English teacher, the social media stuff about tracking how many books you read in a year, the folks who tell you it is political or resistance or moral or healthy like vegetables or a hack for getting ahead. Itâ€™s not competition. There is no test. Itâ€™s something *you want to do.* Full stop.

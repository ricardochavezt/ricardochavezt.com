Bring fruit to work. Bring fruit to bed! Illustrations: Leon Edler/The Guardian

Whether it’s taking fruit to work (and to the bedroom!), being polite to rude strangers or taking up skinny-dipping, here’s a century of ways to make life better, with little effort involved …

**1** Exercise on a Monday night (nothing fun happens on a Monday night).

**2** On the fence about a purchase? Wait 72 hours before you buy it.

**3** Tip: the quickest supermarket queue is always behind the fullest trolley (greeting, paying and packing take longer than you think).

**4** Bring fruit to work. Bring fruit to bed!

**5** Consider going down to four days a week. It’s likely a disproportionate amount of your fifth day’s work is taxed anyway, so you’ll lose way less than a fifth of your take-home pay.

**6** Everyone has an emotional blind spot when they fight. Work out what yours is, and remember it.

**7** Plant spring bulbs, even if they’re just in a pot.

**8** Send a voice note instead of a text; they sound like personal mini podcasts.

**9** Keep a bird feeder by a window, ideally the kitchen. It’ll pass the time when you’re washing up.

**10** Always bring ice to house parties (there’s never enough).

**11 **Get the lighting right: turn off the overhead one, turn on lots of lamps (but turn off when you leave the room).

**12** Sharpen your knives.

**13** Feeling sluggish at work? Try the [Pomodoro technique](https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/aug/18/productive-at-work-neuroscientists-advice-multitasking): 25 minutes on, five-minute break, and repeat.

**14** Buy a cheap blender and use it to finely chop onions (it saves on time and tears).

**15** Keep your children’s drawings and paintings. Put the best ones in frames.

**16** Set aside 10 minutes a day to do something you really enjoy – be it reading a book or playing [Halo](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/dec/06/halo-infinite-review-old-school-blasting-in-sci-fi-dad-game).

**17** Don’t be weird about how to stack the dishwasher.

**18** Reuse all plastic bags – even bread bags. Much of the packaging you can’t reuse can be taken to larger [branches of supermarkets](https://www.recyclenow.com/what-to-do-with/plastic-film) for recycling.

**19** Take a photo of the tag you are given when leaving your coat in a cloakroom.

**20** Can’t sleep? Try a relaxing soak with lavender bath oil before bed.

**21** Add the milk at least one minute after the tea has brewed.

**22** Laugh shamelessly at your own jokes.

**23** It might sound obvious, but a pint of water before bed after a big night avoids a clanger of a hanger.

**24** Start a Saturday morning with some classical music – it sets the tone for a calm weekend.

**25** Look closely.

**26** Set time limits for your apps. Just go to the settings on your smartphone and add a limit – for example, if you have an iPhone [turn on Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/aside/iph7e81fd7d8/15.0/ios/15.0).

**27** If possible, take the stairs.

**28** Always be willing to miss the next train.

**29** Eat meat once a week, max. Ideally less.

**30** Be polite to rude strangers – it’s oddly thrilling.

**31** Ask questions, and listen to the answers.

**32** Connect with nature: stand outside barefoot for a few minutes – even when it’s cold.

**33** Join your local library – and use it. Find yours [here](https://gov.uk/local-library-services.).

**34** Go for a walk without your phone.

**35** Eat salted butter (life’s too short for unsalted).

**36** Stretch in the morning. And maybe in the evening.

**37** If you’re going less than a mile, walk or cycle. About half of car journeys are under two miles, yet these [create more pollution](https://www.greenchoices.org/green-living/transport/car-use#:~:text=Don't use a car for shorter journeys.&text=72% of journeys are under,, 50% under 2 miles.&text=Very short journeys are too,really don't need it!) than longer journeys as the engine isn’t warmed up yet.

**38** Sleep with your phone in a different room (and buy an alarm clock).

**39** Send postcards from your holidays. Send them even if you’re not on holiday.

**40** Instead of buying new shoes, get old ones resoled and buy new laces.

**41** Buy a plant. Think you’ll kill it? Buy a fake one.

42 Don’t have Twitter on your phone.

**43** If you find an item of clothing you love and are certain you will wear for ever, buy three.

**44** Try taking a cold shower (30 seconds to two minutes) before your hot one. It’s good for your health – both physical and mental.

**45** Text to say thank you.

**46** Read a poem every day. Keep a compendium, such as [A Poem for Every Day of the Year](https://guardianbookshop.com/a-poem-for-every-day-of-the-year-9781509860548), by your bed.

**47** Take out your headphones when walking – listen to the world.

**48** Buy secondhand.

**49** Buy in person!

**50** Learn [how to floss properly](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/dental-health/why-should-i-use-dental-floss/).

**51** If something in the world is making you angry, [write (politely) to your MP](https://members.parliament.uk/) – they will read it.

**52** Say hello to your neighbours.

**53** Learn the basics of repairing your clothes.

[https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday](https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/inside-saturday)

**54** Always bring something – wine, flowers – to a dinner/birthday party, even if they say not to.

**55** Learn the names of 10 trees.

**56** Call an old friend out of the blue.

**57** Every so often, search your email for the word “unsubscribe” and then use it on as many as you can.

**58** Buy a newspaper. (Ideally this one.)

**59** Always have dessert.

**60** Drop your shoulders.

**61** Make something from scratch. Works best if it’s something you’d normally buy, such as a dress or a bag.

**62** Go to bed earlier – but don’t take your phone with you.

**63** Volunteer. Go to gov.uk/government/get-involved for ideas.

**64** Dry your cutlery with a cloth (it keeps it shiny).

**65** Instead of buying a morning coffee, set up a daily transfer of £2 from a current into a savings account and forget about it. Use it to treat yourself to something different later.

**66** Don’t save things for “best”. Wear them – *enjoy* them.

**67** Sing!

68 Think about your posture: don’t slouch, and don’t cross your legs.

**69** Hang your clothes up. Ideally on non-wire hangers (it’s better for them).

**70** Skinny-dip with friends.

**71** Switch your phone off on holiday (or at least delete your work email app).

**72** Always use freshly ground pepper.

**73** Thank a teacher who changed your life.

**74** Respect your youngers.

**75** Keep your keys in the same place.

**76** Ditch the plastic cartons and find a milkman – [The Modern Milkman](https://themodernmilkman.co.uk/) has a comprehensive list.

**77** Rent rather than buy a suit/dress for that forthcoming wedding (even if it’s your own).

**78** Always book an extra day off after a holiday.

**79** Ignore the algorithm – listen to music outside your usual taste.

**80** Mute or leave a WhatsApp group chat.

**81** Learn a TikTok dance (but don’t post it on TikTok).

**82** Cook something you’ve never attempted before.

**83** Join a local litter-picking group.

**84** Handwash that thing you’ve never cleaned.

**85** Don’t get a pet/do get a pet.

**86** Nap.

**87** Learn how to breathe deeply: in through the nose, out through the mouth, making the exhale longer than the inhale.

**88** Buy a bike and use it. Learn how to fix it, too.

**89** Politely decline invitations if you don’t want to go.

**90** If you do go, have an exit strategy (can we recommend a French exit, where you slip out unseen).

**91** If in doubt, add cheese.

**92** Don’t look at your phone at dinner.

## 3 IDEAS FROM ME

I.

“Move toward the next thing, not away from the last thing.

Same direction. Completely different energy.”

[Share this on Twitter](https://ctt.ac/1H9fM)

II.

“Guilt lives in the past.

Worry lives in the future.

Peace lives in the present.”

[Share this on Twitter](https://ctt.ac/5VuQe)

III.

“Mastery requires lots of practice. But the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes.

Thus, an essential component of mastery is the ability to maintain your enthusiasm. The master continues to find the fundamentals interesting.”

## 2 QUOTES FROM OTHERS

I.

Novelist and poet **Robert Louis Stevenson** on the shortness of life:

“Old and young, we are all on our last cruise.”

*Source: **[Crabbed Age and Youth (1877)](https://amzn.to/3VnJ74b)*

II.

Travel writer and essayist **Alice Wellington Rollins** on the importance of drive:

“The test of a student is not how much he knows, but how much he wants to know.”

*Source: **[Aphorisms for the Year (1897)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Aphorisms_for_the_Year/Gd8VAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=“The test of a student is not how much he knows, but how much he wants to know.”&pg=PA9&printsec=frontcover)*

## 1 QUESTION FOR YOU

How can I overlap the things I enjoy?

For example, maybe you want to exercise and spend time with your spouse. What type of exercise sounds fun to do with your spouse?

Or perhaps you’d like to hang out with friends and build your career. How can you find ways to work with people you like being around?

It doesn’t always work, but there are usually a few areas of life you can overlap in an enjoyable way. Look for the overlap.

Until next week,

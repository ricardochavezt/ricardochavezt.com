a reflection as old as time ;)

The highlights:

1. I like how the author compares some of the ideas on the topic with concepts about machine learning (which I think is a topic very familiar to him). Not only is that a very good way of making unfamiliar concepts easier to understand, but it might also uncover connections previously unseen.
2. “… the question ‘when will AI become conscious?’ is the wrong question. The right question is ‘what kinds of consciousness do current AI systems have, and how might those forms of consciousness evolve as the systems become more sophisticated?’”
3. The idea of human consciousness as being augmented by (time-persistent) memory. I think the same idea applies to some other complex systems: without memory that persists across time, even a complex digital system is no better than a simple mechanical machine [reference needed]

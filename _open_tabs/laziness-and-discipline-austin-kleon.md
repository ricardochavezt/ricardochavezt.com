I have written often of the deep connection I feel between [my laziness](https://austinkleon.com/tag/laziness) and my productivity.

Here’s writer [Hanif Abdurraqib](http://www.abdurraqib.com/) on *[The Stephen Satterfield Show](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-poet-with-hanif-abdurraqib/id1679856637?i=1000617823583)*, putting it much more poetically, so much so that I thought it was worth transcribing in full:

> I came to writing significantly later than most of my peers. I have no ‘formal education’ in writing, I didn’t study writing in college, I wasn’t very good at school. But I always had these obsessions and interests and excitements, particularly around music. And for me that meant that for a long time, because I wasn’t a writer, those things were just building, and I would store them. I kind of have an internal archive of excitements and I did not always have access to a place for them….

Satterfield asks him how somebody can be both lazy and disciplined.

> They act in opposition to each other, right?

There’s so much there, and so many phrases I want to clip and build whole pieces out of, like, “an internal archive of excitements” and “joyful extraction.” It’s also impossible for me not to try to read an Ohio thing into it. (Hanif and I were born the same year and grew up about 45 minutes away from each other.)

I also want to join Hanif’s [Church Of Minding One’s Own Business](https://twitter.com/NifMuhammad/status/1666238210811256834). Elsewhere [he has said](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/14/books/hanif-abdurraqib-little-devil-america-national-book-awards.html), “My superpower is that I mind my own business. And I actually think that helps my productivity more than anything.”

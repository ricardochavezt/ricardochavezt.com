Hank Green on what is, in his opinion, the secret to his success.

We have been sold the “follow your dreams ✨✨” advice a lot, and yet, as he puts it, if you *blindly* follow your dreams, you might miss on greater / more interesting opportunities. And this resonates a lot with me because I think I have been unknowingly following his advice: the last years have been a mix of having a set of loose goals and making use of the opportunities that landed on my lap, or whatever tools / options I had available at the moment.

Some advice from author Amber Sparks on how to use all the interesting bits of information one comes across / collects. It is targeted at fiction authors, but maybe, as [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/overheard-on-the-titanic) puts it, it can be useful for non-fiction authors or, dare I say, everyone else.

To wit:
1. _Buy a LOT of notebooks_ and start separating your interesting things by topic
2. _Get a bulletin board or really big piece of paper or reserve a wall in your house or office or apartment_ and then use it to connect your ideas with red string like in the detective shows (or the meme of the crazy conspiracy guy ðŸ˜†)
3. _Think about the characters you have, and how you can feed them the information youâ€™re gathering_
4. _Jump around in time_: time travelers, storylines happening in different times, flashbacks, etc.
5. _Remember the iceberg_: not everything needs to be _in_ the book
6. _Pare back_: if it doesn't fit, then it doesn't fit

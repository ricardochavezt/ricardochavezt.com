title: About this garden
---

Hello and welcome! You have landed in the digital garden section of my personal website, created with the purpose of saving all the interesting things I come across in the Internet, and hopefully, with a little of maintenance, see if some connections, patterns, or topics emerge, and note those down.

It is organized liked so: on top I have the interesting things (articles, videos, etc.) that I would like to share and also keep a bookmark on. I nicknamed it "Open Tabs" because the idea is for it to reduce the number of open tabs in my browser(s) without losing sight of the interesting content; on that same line of thought, the idea is to include some short text highlighting what caught my eye, because it has happened to me before that I keep some page open in my browser because I think it's interesting, and then go back to it after some time having completely forgotten _which_ part I found interesting ðŸ˜….

Below I have the longer notes, intended to expand on any topic that I find interesting. The idea is to implement something close to what is showcased in the original post about digital gardening, [The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/), i.e. use the longer notes to connect the dots and sort of think aloud about a topic in particular. As such, they are less like blog posts and more like constantly-evolving notes or mini essays (I might eventually steal the idea of "growth stages" from [Maggie Appleton's digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden)).

And last, right beside the longer notes, I have a collection of reposts of other content, short status updates and other miscellaneous content, nicknamed "the Stream" (stealing again from [the original digital gardening essay](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)). The difference between this section and the Open Tabs is that the latter is intended to add to my personal knowledge database and to be referenced by the longer notes, while the Stream is simply things I have liked or found funny or amusing; it would be the ideal place for pictures I like, memes or my favorite song of the moment.

As of the date of last update of this note, these sections are implemented in a very basic way: the Open Tabs section is just an embed of a Notion database where I've been keeping my interesting reads bookmarked, the Stream is just [my Tumblr](http://ricardochavezt.tumblr.com/) embedded, and the longer notes use the default config of [the digital garden template](maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) from which I created this site. The idea for the next version is to replace both embeds with notes stored in the same place as the longer notes, so that all my content is kept in the same place, and then selectively reposted in other networks (at least for the Stream); for that, however, I would need something that would allow me to create such notes with the same ease as when I add something to Notion or share it to Tumblr. (For that, something based on [Micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub) would work, I think.)
